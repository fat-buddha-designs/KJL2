    Making a will, ensures that specific
    intentions you have for the disposal of
    your assets after your death can be
    carried out. Many people wrongly assume
    that when they die their next-of-kin
    will automatically receive the whole of
    their estate. If you die without making
    a valid will you die "intestate".

    “I want to thank you for the time and
    support you have given me concerning
    this matter. The way you offered to help
    complete strangers meant a lot to me and
    money can’t buy kindness, enclosed
    find vouchers, a small token of my
    appreciation. Once again my sincerest
    thanks.”

    “Taking our calls out of hours and
    particularly at weekends to hold our
    hands and eradicate our fears through
    moments of extreme worry. You shone like
    a star and delivered as promised the
    result which we never thought possible.
    We have never known a lawyer who has
    delivered to such a high standard with
    such a likeable persona. We will
    definitely be using you again in the
    future and will recommend you to all we
    know.”

    “Every inch the London Lawyer you
    promised you were and what a result
    against opposition equally matched. How
    can we ever thank you and find suitable
    praise for your genius.”

    “I was given options that gave me
    confidence to know there was a way
    forward. To empower and encourage people
    to make the move forward is enlightening
    as it can be frightening when facing a
    large company”.
