## Redundancy

Redundancy is a form of dismissal from a job. Genuine reasons for redundancy include:-

- New technology or a new system of work that has made your job unnecessary or surplus to requirements
- The job you were hired to do no longer exists
- The economy is such that there is a need to cut costs which could mean staff numbers being reduced
- The business is closing down or moving

Consultation: In a redundancy situation, the following things should happen:-

- Your employer should be able to demonstrate that you have been selected fairly from the pool of employees
- You should be consulted about the redundancy and given the opportunity to discuss potential redeployment options should they exist.  Alternatives to redundancy should be considered in every case by the employer
- If your position will cease you may be offered outreach programmes or given time off for interviews
- If you are made redundant you should be given any redundancy pay you are entitled to and be given the correct amount of notice
- Your entitlement to redundancy can be calculated using the following link: Redundancy Entitlement

The link will then calculate for you (by hitting the submit button) the amount of redundancy pay you are entitled to by law. This does not take account of any enhanced redundancy rights you may be entitled to by virtue of your contract of employment.

If you are dismissed by way of redundancy and:-

- Your post continues to exist.
- Your selection was without merit
- The new owners of the business simply want to move across and keep on their own existing staff

It may be that you were unfairly dismissed and have a claim against your employer.
