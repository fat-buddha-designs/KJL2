We advise on the terms and conditions of your employment contract telling you what employment rights you have. We will discuss what restrictions and liabilities are being placed on you both during and after your employment.

We will tell you what the notice period you will be required to work on leaving your employment and in what circumstances you can be summarily dismissed.

We will advise you as to the employerâ€™s disciplinary process and your rights under that process.

We can advise whether you will loose your intellectual or copyright in anything you design or write whilst working for your employer.

We will tell you whether you can be prevented from working in the same industry for a period of time after you leave your employment and what information may be deemed confidential and which you cannot share elsewhere.

We will discuss within the terms of your employment contract what use of the company mobile phone you are permitted, whether access to information on the internet is restricted or allowed.

We can advise on downloads, use of company credit cards and liabilities in relation to your personal use of any company vehicle.

Can your employer legally vary your contract of employment or worse terminate it. Can you be issued with a new contract with less favourable terms? What are your employment rights with your present contract?

At KJL Solicitors we want to ensure that you are fully aware of all your contractual rights and what Employment Legislation exists to protect you.
