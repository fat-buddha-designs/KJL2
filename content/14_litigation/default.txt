Disputes occur for a multitude of reasons, some foreseeable, others not.

We offer guidance in all commercial areas such as general business disputes, intellectual property, shipping, building and construction disputes, through to consumer and contract problems.  

Since the small claims limit increased in 2013 we now offer fixed fees for assisting you with claims up to value of £5000 and for claims between the value of £5000 to £10,000.  

See our fixed fee structure set out on our news page "read more" for details or telephone (tel: 01603717520 arialabel: call KJL Solicitors text: 01603 717520) to ask for further information.

Our strategic lawyers will guide you to the most cost efficient way out of any conflict.

From January 2011 we have the benefit of our own dedicated mediation centre. It may be that you never need to see the door of a court if your matter can be amicably settled through this non-litigious route.

KJL Solicitors are highly specialised litigators, but can offer in-house Mediation, Adjudication, Conciliation and Arbitration as alternative dispute resolution processes rather than go to court.  

We are also professional panel members of the Dispute Board Federation and can assist in both U.K. and International disputes.  

Let our experts guide you through the one stop dispute resolution experience for all your personal and business disputes.

If you either have a problem or can see one developing, then please do not hesitate to contact us for advice at KJL Solicitors, Blofield Chambers, The Street, Blofield, Norwich, NR13 4AA. 

We are based just outside Norwich within minutes of the A47 and with parking right outside our offices.
