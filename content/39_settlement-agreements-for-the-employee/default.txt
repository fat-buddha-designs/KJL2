If you are offered a settlement agreement from your employer you will need to have this signed off by a qualified solicitor.  

In most cases your employer will contribute to the cost of your legal fees for the signing off of they agreement, (This does not apply to all settlement agreements and is ultimately at the total discretion of your employer).

Settlement agreements are commonly used by employers to prevent Employment Tribunal Claims being brought against them post termination of an individual employeeâ€™s contract of employment.

A settlement agreement can be used for example as a gagging device, preventing you from telling co-workers or anyone else as to the terms of how your employment terminated and on what basis any compensation was paid to you, if any. 

They may also be used to buy your employment rights from you for example in a situation where in ordinary course you may have have been entitled to commence an employment claim against your employer.

At KJL Solicitors we will discuss with you any employment rights and potential claims you may have in order to determine whether the amount of compensation under the agreement, if any, is reflective to your personal and individual employment right and circumstances.

However, remember that not all Settlement Agreements result in compensation payments.
