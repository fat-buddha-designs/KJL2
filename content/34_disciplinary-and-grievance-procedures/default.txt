Raising a grievance can be a good way of resolving disputes. 

We have advised many potential claimants who have a right to bring a constructive dismissal claim how to instigate the grievance process. 

With proper process and an outline knowledge of their legal rights, many employee's have managed to negotiate better contract terms, reinstatement of their jobs and payment where unlawful deductions from wages have been made. 

In short, the basis of their dispute has been resolved and they continued to remain happily employed.

Grievances can also be useful in circumstances where victimisation and bullying within the workforce is occurring. 

Every employee's grievance is different and any advice given will be on the facts and merits of each individual case.
