## Accessibility Policy

We’ve built this website to make it easier for all web users to contact 'KJL Solicitors' or find out more about us.

You can always zoom in or out if that works better for you.

Press CTRL + PLUS SIGN (+) to zoom in.

Press CTRL + HYPHEN (-) to zoom out.

We have added ALT tags to all images, ALT Tags are invisible descriptions of images which are read aloud to blind users on a screen reader. Adding ALT text allows us to include images, but still provide the content in an alternative text based format. If no ALT tags are provided, then a screen reader would only be able to say "IMAGE" or perhaps provide a file name, which is not helpful and does not make for a good experience.

We also make use of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes where possible. ARIA is a set of special accessibility attributes which can be added to any markup, but is especially suited to HTML. The role attribute defines what the general type of object is (such as an article, alert, or slider).

The aria-label attribute is used to define a string that labels the current element. Use it in cases where a text label is not visible on the screen.

The aria-hidden attribute is used to hide elements, such as icon names; that would otherwise make following a web page difficult for screen readers.

We have included a Langauge Tag, this tag is designed to signal screen readers pronunciation engines which language to use.

We also avoid the use of flashing images, so as not to effect people who are prone to photosensitive epilepsy, as per the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) guidelines.

Where we have used moving images, we ensure that the movement lasts no longer than 5  seconds as per WCAG 2.0 Success Criterion 2.2.2 (Level A).
