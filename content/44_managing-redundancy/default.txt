This is an everyday part of an Employment Lawyers roll, managing and advising upon redundancy situations. Redundancies will be undoubtedly more prevalent during the time of the “Credit Crunch”.

We have assisted organisations in mass redundancy situations as well as instances where just a few employees are being made redundant. We will assist the employer to identify those positions or staff members who are “at risk”. 

We will then advise on the selection and consultation process which must take place, including the best way to manage that process depending on size and needs of the business. 

We look at the staff composition, re-organisational requirements and any possible redeployment factors within the business, coupled with all the employee’s acquired employment rights from the pool of selected staff.

If an employees position is not technically redundant and re-deployment has not even been considered, the employer will leave the organisation wide open to claims for unfair dismissal and procedural failings.

We will advise on the most painless and most cost effective measures the employer can taking in handling such situations. 

We will calculate redundancy packages where required and draft compromise agreements where these become the most suitable option to protect you “The Employer”.
