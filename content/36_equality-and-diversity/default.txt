### Forms of Discrimination
Discrimination occurs when one person is treated less favourably than another is treated, or would be treated, in the same or similar circumstances without legitimate reason.

The grounds upon which a person must not be discriminated against are:
(a) race or racial group (including colour, nationality and ethnic or national origin); (b) sex (including marital status, gender reassignment, pregnancy, maternity and paternity); (c) sexual orientation (including civil partnership status); (d) religion or belief; (e) age; or (f) disability.

Discrimination can take a variety of forms including direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment, victimization, less favourable treatment and failure to make an adjustment.

The following are examples of the kinds of discrimination, which are against the Firm’s policy:

1. **Direct discrimination**
Where a person is treated less favourably on the grounds of age, race, racial group, colour, ethnic or national origins, sex, pregnancy, marital status, disability or sexual orientation or religion or belief.

2. **Indirect discrimination**
Where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put a substantially higher proportion of the members of age, one sex, or persons having a racial or ethnic origin, or a particular religion or belief, or a particular disability or a particular sexual orientation at a particular disadvantage compared with other persons unless that provision, criterion or practice is objectively justified by a legitimate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary.

3. **Victimisation**
Where someone is treated less favourably that others because he or she has taken action against the Firm under one of the relevant Acts.

4. **Harassment**
When unwanted conduct related to any of the grounds referred to above takes place with the purpose or effect of violating the dignity of a person and of creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment.  Harassment may involve physical acts or verbal and non-verbal communications and gestures.  This will include physical, verbal and non-verbal acts.

5.  **Less favourable treatment**
In respect of disability discrimination, this occurs when a person with a disability is treated in a detrimental way in circumstances when a person without that disability would not be so treated.
