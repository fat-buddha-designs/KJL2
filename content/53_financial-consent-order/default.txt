Divorcing couples can create a Consent Order (also known as a Clean Break Order) to ensure that any financial agreement reached by them is legally binding and that no party can make further claims against the other after the divorce has been made absolute. A Consent Order must be filed at a divorce court and approved by a Judge to be enforceable in law.

## Why do I need a Financial Consent Order?

The divorce process itself only arranges the dissolution of your marriage and doesn’t include your financial arrangements after divorce.

To stop you or your ex coming back to the divorce court at a later date to sort out any financial problems, it’s best to put the terms of your financial agreement into a legally-binding court order which dismisses any future financial claims after your divorce.
