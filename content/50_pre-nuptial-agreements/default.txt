Pagecontent:

Pre-nuptial agreements are becoming increasingly common in the United Kingdom especially with couples of substantial means. 

Pre-nuptials are perceived by many to be pessimistic and unromantic, while in reality they can avoid the time, expense and acrimony commonly experienced in divorce settlements.

In many other countries pre-nuptial agreements are binding. This is rapidly becoming the case in England and Wales and Judges are now attaching more weight to them in circumstances where there are no children, independent advice was sought by both parties prior to signing the agreement and on the whole the agreement seems fair.
