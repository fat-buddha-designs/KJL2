Pagecontent:

The broad application of IP rights affects all manner of intellectual capital in just about any creative field. In recent years the importance of IP rights has been recognised by legislative reform seeing for example the introduction of moral rights and database rights.

Forward thinking enterprises face the challenge of extracting the explicit value of their intellectual property and using it effectively in their business strategies. Companies that dedicate time and resources to protecting their intellectual property may increase their competitiveness in a variety of ways. Intellectual property protection helps in:-

- preventing competitors from copying or closely imitating a company's products or services;
- creating a corporate identity through a trademark and branding strategy;
- negotiating licensing, franchising or other IP-based contractual agreements thereby increasing the market value of the company.
