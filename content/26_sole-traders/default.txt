Being a sole trader is the simplest way to get started in business. Once you have informed the government agencies of your intentions to set up as self employed, you can start trading right away (subject to any specific licences you or your business activity) might require in order to trade.

As a sole trader you are personally responsible for all liabilities of the business should anything go wrong. It is worth spending time considering which company set-up format is best for you. 

Once you start trading as a sole trader you must register with HM Revenue & Customs as self employed even if you have already sent in a tax return. 

There are some exceptions and special rules for particular industries, like the construction industry, however by in large if you do not register the moment you begin to trade, you could incur a financial penalty. 

You will also have to pay class 2 national insurance contributions and then class 4 contributions on your profits. 

It is easy to start off as a sole trader and then change the way you trade later should the needs of your business require it. 

For those who work for an old employer or only have one client in their business you should check whether the HM Revenue & Customs will consider you as a self employed trader. 

In many instances the Revenue may well consider that those working for one client or one ex-employer is actually an employee of that business irrespective of your sole trader label.
