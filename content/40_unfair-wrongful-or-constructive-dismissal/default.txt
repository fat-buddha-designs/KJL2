We have acted for a substantial number of employees who have been unfairly dismissed, wrongfully dismissed or as a result of an action or event have had to claim constructive dismissal. 

There are strict time limits in bringing a tribunal claim if you believe you have been unfairly dismissed you should contact us without delay.

There are reasons which will allow your employer to fairly dismiss you, such reasons may include for example:-

- Your conduct
- Your capability to do your job, this includes long terms sickness or ill health
- You were dismissed legitimately by way of redundancy
- Retirement (subject to some exceptions)
- A statutory restriction - e.g. you lose your driving licence when you are required within your job to drive, continuing to employ you would be tantamount to your employer breaking the law
- Substantial reorganisation of the workplace and your refusal to accept changes to your employment terms

### Automatic Reasons For Unfair Dismissal Include:-

Employers must follow certain dismissal procedures before they can lawfully dismiss an employee who has 12 months or more service. 

For workers who have less than 12 months service (their remedy generally is limited to wrongful dismissal) may still fall within the criteria for an automatically unfair dismissal if for example the employee was dismissed for exercising a statutory right, like the right to written particulars of your terms and conditions of employment.

### Other Automatically Unfair Reasons Might Be:-

- Because you are pregnant.
- You take or ask to take statutory maternity, paternity or adoption leave.
- You are or intend to be a trade union member, or you refuse to join a union.
- You exercise your rights under the National Minimum Wage Act.
- You complain about a health and safety problems at work or report wrongdoing known as ‘whistleblowing’.
- You exercise your rights in connection with a statutory grievance or disciplinary procedure.
- You take part in official industrial action that lasts less than 12 weeks.
- You are required to take time off for jury service.
- You ask to work flexibly providing you have the right to do so.
- You exercise your rights under the Working Time Regulations.

Where an employee is dismissed due to Sex, Race, Age or Disability discrimination, an employee should bring a claim for discrimination rather than unfair dismissal. If successful they are likely to receive more compensation.

There are many situations where a dismissal will be unfair, talk to us to find out in greater detail whether you have been treated unfairly.
