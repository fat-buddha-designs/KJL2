We will take the time to discuss all your needs, as we want to understand exactly what it is you intend to do by way of a business so we can apply our expertise on how best to protect you and your business once up and running.

As strategic business solicitors as well as litigators we understand just about every pitfall a business may face and with that knowledge we can ensure you put in place protections to steer you on the right path when setting up. 

We will discuss the benefits and pitfalls of trading as a limited company, partnership or sole trader.  

We will discuss fully not just the best way to trade but we will also provide sound advice about laws and compliance issues you will need to think about prior to trading.

Come and talk to one of our specialist solicitors and let us give you the business start up advice that will set you on your way.
