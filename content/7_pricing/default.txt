###How long will my house purchase take?

How long it will take from your offer being accepted until you can move into your house will depend on a number of factors, such as when we get the contract papers, how long searches are taking, if there is a chain of parties involved, when we receive your mortgage offer and how quickly the other side deals with the enquiries are raised. The average process takes between 8-12 weeks but this is the average and can vary depending on the circumstances and properties of the parties.

###Stages of the process

The precise stages involved in the purchase of a residential property vary according to the circumstances. However, below we have suggested some key stages:-

###Probate
We do not and have never changed a percentage of the deceased’s estate when dealing with probate and administration of estates. Our fees are charged on an hourly rate and are set out below by way of example.

You will always be given a fee quotation once we have full information on your requirement’s but our charges might look something like those set down below:

Applying for the grant, collecting and distributing the assets

We anticipate a small estate will take between 5 to 12 hours work at £235.00 per hour plus VAT. Total costs estimated at £1175 + VAT lower end of the scale to £2820 + VAT at the higher end.

The exact cost will depend on the individual circumstances of the matter. For example, if there is one beneficiary and no property, costs are likely to be lower than the lower end quote above. If there are multiple beneficiaries, a property and multiple bank accounts, costs will be at the higher end and may even exceed the higher example fee quoted.

We will handle the full process for you. This quote is for examples of estates where:-

- There is a valid will
- There is no more than one property
- There are no more than 5 bank or building society accounts
- There are no other intangible assets
- There are 2-5 beneficiaries
- There are no disputes between beneficiaries on the division of assets. If disputes arise this is likely to lead to an increase in costs
- There is no inheritance tax payable and the executors do not need to submit a full account to HMRC
- There are no claims made against the estate

Disbursements in addition to our estimated fees are:-

Probate application fee of £215.00
£7.00 Swearing of the oath (per executor)
Bankruptcy-only Land Charges Department searches (£2.00 per beneficiary)
£84.60 Post in The London Gazette – Protects against unexpected claims from unknown creditors.
Post in a Local Newspaper – will also help to protect against unexpected claims.
Disbursements are costs related to your matter that are payable to third parties, such as court fees. We handle the payment of the disbursements on your behalf to ensure a smoother process.

**Potential additional costs**

If there is no will or the estate consists of any shareholdings (stocks and bonds) there is likely to be additional costs that could range significantly depending on the estate and how it is to be dealt with. We can give you a more accurate quote once we have more information.
If any additional copies of the grant are required, they will cost £1.50 (1 per asset usually).
Dealing with the sale or transfer of any property in the estate is not included.
How long will this take?

On average, estates that fall within this range are dealt with within 3-6 months. Typically, obtaining the grant of probate takes 2-5 weeks. Collecting assets then follows, which can take between 4-8 weeks. Once this has been done, we can distribute the assets, which normally takes 1-2 weeks.

We can help you through this difficult process by obtaining the Grant of Probate on your behalf. We will also undertake the collecting and distributing of assets.

###Debt Recovery

These costs apply where your claim is in relation to an unpaid invoice that is not disputed and enforcement action is not needed. If the other party disputes your claim at any point, we will discuss any further work required and provide you with revised advice about costs if necessary, which could be on a fixed fee (e.g. if a one-off letter is required), or an hourly rate if more extensive work is needed.

Debts up to £5,000
1 hours consultation plus initial letter before action - £235 plus VAT

Debts up to £20,000
1 hour consultation plus initial letter before action - £235 plus VAT

Debts up to £50,000
1 hour consultation plus initial letter before action - £325.50 plus VAT

Anything above the £50,000 limit should seek a tailored quotation

Our fees for small claim limits disputes are already on our website under “Civil Litigation Fixed Fees in Small Claims”

Anyone wishing to proceed with a claim should note that:

The VAT element of our fee cannot be reclaimed from your debtor.
Interest and compensation may take the debt into a higher banding, with a higher cost.
The costs quoted above are not for matters where enforcement action, such as the bailiff, is needed to collect your debt.

Our fee includes:-

- Taking your instructions and reviewing documentation
- Undertaking appropriate searches
- Sending a letter before action
- Receiving payment and sending onto you, or if the debt is not paid, drafting and issuing claim
- Where no Acknowledgment of Service or Defence is received, applying to the court to enter Judgement in default
- When Judgement in default in received, write to the other side to request payment
- If payment is not received within X days, providing you with advice on next steps and likely costs

Matters usually take 30 days – 6 weeks from receipt of instructions from you to receipt of payment from the other side, depending on whether or not it is necessary to issue a claim. This is on the basis that the other side pays promptly on receipt of Judgement in default. If enforcement action is needed, the matter will take longer to resolve.
